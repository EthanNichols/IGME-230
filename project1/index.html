				<h1>Overall Idea</h1>
				<p>RIT needs to be moved out of Rochester, and needs to be rebuilt. It's up to you to create bricks to rebuild the Institute back to it's glory!</p>
				<p>Hire students to make bricks for you, and pay them with education, the more building built with your patented brick color makes them work harder</p>
				<p>Support education and college workers by building the institute that you would like to go to, out of nothing but bricks!</p>
