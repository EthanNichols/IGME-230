			<h1>Concept</h1>
			<p>RIT needs bricks to rebuild, after being told to move the location of RIT</p>
			<p>Start from nothing and accumulate upgrades to increase the amount of bricks you can make exponentially</p>
		</div>

		<div class="description proposalDiv">
			<h1>Game Genre</h1>
			<p>RIT's Brick Factory is an idle progression game</p>
			<p>You start from nothing, and slowly accumulate upgrades to exponentially create bricks</p>
		</div>

		<div class="description proposalDiv">
			<h1>Platforms</h1>
			<p>RIT's Brick Factory will be availible on any browser and accessible by computers from the very beginning</p>
			<p>In the future this could be ported to Android and IOS as a downloadable app.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="description proposalDiv">
			<h1>Story</h1>
			<p>RIT needs to be moved out of Rochester, and needs to be rebuilt. It's up to you to create bricks to rebuild the Institute back to it's glory!</p>
			<p>Hire students to make bricks for you, and pay them with education, the more building built with your patented brick color makes them work harder</p>
			<p>Support education and college workers by building the institute that you would like to go to, out of nothing but bricks!</p>
		</div>

		<div class="description proposalDiv">
			<h1>Esthetics</h1>
			<p>The majority of the game will have simplistic art since the graphics don't need to be complicated.</p>
			<p>The style will be with pixel art, since it's a simplistic art form, and can be made easily</p>
		</div>

			<h1>Esthetics</h1>
			<p>Mechanics</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Clicking to create bricks manually</li>
					<li>Upgrades to automatically create bricks</li>
					<li>Recreate mechanics, where you can create more RITs after you finish one RIT</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Controls</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Mouse clicking (Computer only)</li>
					<li>Finger tapping (touch screen devices / mobile)</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Teaching players / learning curve</p>
			<p>There isn't much to teach players, and the overall mechanics of the game are simplistic, since there isn't any way to win or lose</p>
			<p>The one thing the player can learn is what is the most efficient route to buying upgrades to increase their brick creation exponentially faster.</p>
