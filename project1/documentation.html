				<p>Recieved a critique and suggestions to change for the website</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Lightened the browns in the color pallette</li>
					<li>Increased the amount of padding in the brick text</li>
					<li>Shortened the size of navagation bar to be less annoying</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>9 / 26 / 17</h1>
				<p>Created the layout and the color scheme for the website.</p>
				<p>The website should have a brick feeling to it, since the point of the game is to make bricks</p>
				<p>I feel like the layout fits the theme of the game, and the colors represent the style of the game</p>

			<div class="description">
				<h1>9 / 20 / 17</h1>
				<p>Created a markdown document for the overall basics for the game</p>
				<p>This document can be view on <a href="https://github.com/EthanNichols/IGME-230/blob/master/project1/230-project-1-content.md">Github</a></p>

				<h1>Above and Beyond</h1>
				<p>Rit needs more bricks and this game will help people realize that you can only advance with the more bricks that you have</p>
				<p>I also broke out of my comfort zone with this design, I generally go for one page designs, but this one you have to scroll</p>
				<p>Finally it might not have been obvious, but all the description elements are supposed to look like bricks</p>
