				<p class="orangeBack blackBorder">One of my main goals is to work on team projects to further develope my coding skill, and work with others. What I plan to get out of my major is the ability to make software to entertain people, whether it's a game or an interactive project. By going to RIT I hope to meet people who I can bounce ideas off of, as well as work with on projects. Finally in the future as long as I am coding, I think I will be happy, I would prefer to work for a Game Developement company, but I am not picky.</p>
