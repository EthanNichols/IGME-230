					<p>Magic the gathering is a CCG that has an in depth list of mechanics, and rules for when you face other people with your cards. While some cards are over powered, most of them are generally balanced, and the overpowered cards are banned from being used in play. This is one of my hobbies, since it takes some strategy to defeat your opponent with the cards that you have. Sometimes the cards you have affect the game, but the main part is knowing how to play your cards, and come up with a strategy to defeat your opponent.</p>

					<p>Over time I have shifted my focus from wanting to go into game design, to game developement / software engineering. Mainly becuase I want to work with only programming, and not have to think about how things will intereact or be in the final product. While I know game design, I don't want my career to revolve around designing, and focus more on programming.</p>

					<p>Overall I have enjoyed most of the classes that IGM has offered, and I am hoping that all this great content will continue on in the future.</p>
